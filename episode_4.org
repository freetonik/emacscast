  - Thierry Volpiatto [[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2083][stalling the active development of Helm]]

**** Config news
- move-text
- ox-hugo
- multiple cursors
- simple mode line
- which-key
- visual regexp
- shackle
- NeoTree
- company
- reformatted config a bit

**** Spacemacs
- Created by Sylvain Benner, lives in Quebec city, Canada; now more than 100 contributors
- Community-driven distribution
  - in Emacs, things like this are easy to try, just replace =~/.emacs.d=
  - focused on ergonomics, mnemonics and consistency
  - Evil, Projectile, Helm, which-key, powerline, theme + lots of sane defaults, lots of configured packages
  - layers: pre-configured sets
    - prompt to install when needed
  - Evil mode
    - extensive vim emulation
    - primary audience seems to be vim refugees
    - some conventions are different from Vanilla Emacs
      - =SPC w o= is other frame, but =C-x o= is other window
      - =SPC w 2= makes column (vertical split), but =C x 2= makes horizontal split
      - =SPC w 1= does nothing, but in vanilla it kills other windows
      - =SPC w f= is follow mode, but in vanilla it's usually =F=
      - But switching to windows is cool with =SPC 1=, =SPC 2=, etc.
    - some vanilla bindings don't work (=C-t=), some are arguably harder to type (=SPC x t w= vs =M-t= to transpose word)
    - many packages support Evil bindings, but not all and sometimes not too well
  - Spacemacs assumes a familiarity with Emacs (even documentation)
  - It's own config system on top of Emacs
    - Great config with lots of comments and good ideas
    - But many configs are inside other functions, can't easily =C-x e=

***** Advantages
- very well configured, curated and just works
- updates frequently, with auto update notifications
- 'layer' is a good idea, may be a saner 'package' abstraction
- 5 years and active (repodig https://repodig.com/repositories/438)

***** Disadvantages
- whole new layer of complexity
- not beginner friendly
- not all vanilla bindings work, no way to know if a particular instance is due to Spacemacs or something else
- two bad options:
  1. start early and learn non-standard ways, struggle with unrelevant tutorials and help
  2. start late and you have to re-learn bindings and defaults
- nagates the customiztaion selling point of Emacs
- slow-ish, quite heavy

***** Make your own
- Which-key, helm, projectile, evil
- Look into layers
- Steal!

**** Doom Emacs
- Created by Henrik Lissner, lives in Toronto
- Fast, opinionated
- Projectile, Helm/ivy, evil, company
  - popup management with Shackle
- Configs via makefile
  - Modules
- Custom, declarative package management system
- does not work with emacsformacosx.com, needs emacs.plus from Homebrew

***** Advantages
- less space between you and Emacs (unlike Spacemacs)
- very opinionated
- lighter than Spacemacs
  - very fast, especially startup time, some work done on this
- active (4 years)
- looks great

***** Disadvantages
- not beginner friendly
- very opinionated
- less polished than Spacemacs
- module ecosystem is not as good

**** Overall
- My suggestion if you are Emacs-curious and want to learn as much as possible:
  1. Start with vanilla, explore and get comfortable
  2. Try evil yourself
  3. Then try Spacemacs and Doom
- If you want something that works out of the box and not interested in customization - start with Spacemacs
  - If you start fiddling with Spacemacs, maybe consider going vanilla with custom config (http://thume.ca/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/)
